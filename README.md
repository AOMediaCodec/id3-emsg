# Timed metadata in common media application format (CMAF)

Official specification of the AOM group for the carriage of ID3 Timed Metadata in the Common Media Application Format (CMAF).

The specification is written in a special syntax (a mixture of markup and markdown) that enables the creation of cross-references, syntax highlighting, etc. 
The file that uses this syntax is called [index.bs](./index.bs).

The index.bs file is processed to produce an HTML version `index.html` by a tool called [Bikeshed](https://github.com/tabatkins/bikeshed), which is run when content is pushed onto the main branch or when Pull Requests are made.
